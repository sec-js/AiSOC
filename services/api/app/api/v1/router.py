# Air-gap status snapshot for operators — Tier 3.1 (air-gapped certification)

# LLM provider visibility for the "Deployment & AI" Settings panel.

# Agent-facing tool surface (Workstream 4 of AI Stack plan).
# /agents/tools returns the tenant-scoped, downscope-filtered list of
# (connector instance × capability) pairs the agent layer is allowed to
# invoke. Read-only — actual invocation lives in the agents service.
api_router.include_router(agents.router)

# Universal capture push paths (Workstream 6 of AI Stack plan).
# /inbox/templates + /inbox/tokens manage the per-tenant rotatable inbox
# URLs the wizard's "Push (any vendor)" card hands out. Vendor traffic
# itself terminates at services/ingest, which resolves the token to a
# tenant + template_id and reuses the existing OCSF normalizer.
api_router.include_router(inbox.router)

# Bidirectional ITSM webhook receiver (Workstream 8 of AI Stack plan).
# /inbox/itsm/{tenant_token}/{connector_instance_id} accepts inbound
# Jira / ServiceNow webhooks, resolves the external ticket back to its
# AiSOC case via case_external_refs, and mirrors the status onto
# aisoc_cases. This is the *inbound* counterpart to case_fanout (which
# handles outbound AiSOC → ITSM projection) and is what makes the
# operator's existing ITSM the source of truth for case status.
api_router.include_router(inbox_itsm.router)

# Tenant lake API (Workstream 7 of AI Stack plan).
# /lake/sql executes a tenant-scoped SELECT against the warm tier
# (ClickHouse) after passing through the SQL rewriter, which enforces a
# table allowlist, injects tenant_id predicates, clamps LIMIT, and
# rejects DML/DDL/table-valued functions. /lake/schema returns the
# allowlisted table catalog so operators (and LLM agents) can author
# queries without column-name guesswork.
